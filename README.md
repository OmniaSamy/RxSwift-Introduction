# RxSwift-Introduction

 ## Introducation
 Wouldn’t it be better if you could set things up so the code updates reflect changes automatically? That’s the idea of reactive programming: Your application can react to changes in the underlying data without you telling it to do so. This makes it easier to focus on the logic at hand rather than maintaining a particular state.
You can achieve this in Swift through Key-Value Observation and using didSet, but it can be cumbersome to set up. Alternatively, We can use RxSwift that facilitate reactive programming.
